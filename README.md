# Goethe Interactive COVID-19 Analyzer

This repository hosts the codebase associated with the Goethe Interactive COVID-19 Analyzer that allows you to analyze and compare various aspects of data collected all over the world since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This web application exceeds a simple data board showing current infections and other data for different countries across the globe.
It allows the user to freely manipulate, adjust, and relate different data sources.

## Usage

A description of the included features can be found on the webpage. For local testing purposes,
you need to run a local php webserver in the root folder of the repository.

## Running It

Hosting by Uni Frankfurt was discontinued after the end of the pandemic, but you can run the application locally by following these steps:

* Clone the repository on your computer.
* Download a backup of the health data: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13vcSJ4268LoEqjYUZjiMYkPxmXr-Dlw4/view?usp=sharing and extract the `dat` folder into the root folder of the repo.
* Run a local PHP server from the root folder. Under Linux, this would be done e.g. by
```console
$ php -S localhost:8000
```
* Open `localhost:8000` in your browser and start exploring.
